# Configs

Benchmarking cases in `scikit-learn_bench` are defined by configuration files and stored in `configs` directory of repository.

Config defines:
 - Measurement and profiling parameters
 - Library and algorithm to use
 - Algorithm-specific parameters
 - Data to use as input of algorithm

Current configs are splitted into subdirectories and files by benchmarks scope and algorithm.
